            "body": "-0.71%\nGold futures shed some of their luster on Wednesday after a jump in U.S. bond yields, undercut the competitive advantage of owning risk-free Treasuries over bullion.\nTreasury rates punched higher overnight after early returns suggested that Democrats were on track to win both U.S. Senate seats in Georgia and thus control of Congress, an outcome that gives President-elect Joe Biden administration more room to roll out more debt to achieve his policy agendas.\nThe slump for gold comes after it touched a two-month high Tuesday amid the reports on the Georgia political races.\nMarket participants also attributed some of the slide in gold to investors consolidating some of their overnight gains.\nGold and silver futures prices are lower in early U.S. trading Tuesday, on some normal profit taking from the shorter-term futures traders and some chart consolidation after gold hit a two-month high overnight and silver scored a four-month high, wrote Jim Wyckoff, senior analyst at Kitco.com in a daily research note.\nDemocrats may take the Senate\nafter Raphael Warnock won one of two Senate runoffs in Georgia early Wednesday, according to the Associated Press, bringing Democrats a seat closer to a Senate majority. Democratic challenger Jon Ossoff was leading Republican Sen. David Perdue also.\nWith control of the Senate in sight, Democratic lawmakers may now have  scope to pass more aggressive fiscal measures that could weigh on the bond market through increased debt issuance and higher inflation expectations, according to analysts.\nOver the long-term though, greater fiscal measures will likely add to golds value in the longer term though, with the Federal Reserve continuing to monetize some of the debt, bullish investors said.\nTechnically, the February gold futures bulls have the firm overall near-term technical advantage amid a price uptrend in place on the dail",

The Company's Proven and Probable gold Reserves totaled 17.7 million ounces as of\nSeptember 30, 2020\n, compared to 17.5 million ounces as of\nDecember 31, 2019\n, an increase of 1.3%. The complete Mineral Reserve and Resource listing can be found at the end of this release and includes the data for tonnes, grades and contained metal.\nThe slight increase in overall Proven and Probable Reserves was attributable to increases at Kisladag, Lamaque and Perama Hill, offset by decreases at Olympias and Efemcukuru.\nAt Kisladag, Mineral Reserves increased due to a combination of a higher long-term gold price assumption (\n$1,300\n/oz vs\n$1,250\n/oz) and an improved leach recovery model. The latter was derived from additional metallurgical testwork completed in 2020 on gold mineralized material from the south east sector of the planned open pit. The increase at Lamaque was primarily the result of ongoing successful conversion drilling. Perama Hill's Reserve increase resulted from a revised and expanded open pit design which will allow more of the known orebody to be mined.\nDISCLAIMER:  FN Media Group LLC (FNM), which owns and operates Financialnewsmedia.com and MarketNewsUpdates.com, is a third party publisher and news dissemination service provider, which disseminates electronic information through multiple online media channels.
