The right time to buy, of course, is when stocks are priced at the bottom. Buying low and selling high may be a bit hackneyed, but its true, and truth has staying power.But the markets are up. The NASDAQ rose 43% in 2020, and the S&P 500 showed a gain of 16%. With a market environment like that, finding stocks that are caught in the doldrums is harder than it looks. That's where the Wall Street pros can lend a hand.We used TipRanks' database to pinpoint three stocks that fit a profile: a share price that has dropped over 30% in the last 12 months, but with at least double-digit upside potential, according to analysts. Not to mention each has earned a Moderate or Strong Buy consensus rating.Esperion (ESPR)We will start with Esperion, a company that specializes in therapies for the treatment of elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels  a major factor contributing to heart disease. The companys main product, bempedoic acid, is now available in tablet form under the brand names Nexletol and Nexlizet.In February 2020, both Nexletol and Nexlizet were approved as oral treatments to lower LDL-C. Bempedoic acid remains in clinical trials of its efficacy in risk reduction for cardiovascular disease. The trial, called CLEAR Outcomes, is a large-scale, long-term study, tracking more than 14,000 patients with top-line data expected in the second half of 2022. The study covers 1,400 locations in 32 countries around the world.Esperion shares peaked last February, after the FDA approvals, but since then, the stock has declined.

Electrify the boys and girls if you'd be so kind!\nWhen Daft Punk (nee Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo and Thomas Bangalter) released the Tron Legacy soundtrack 10 years ago, there was an obnoxious, whack-a-mole sensibility to the albums bonus tracks, which were scattered across several platforms and providers (one was a Nokia exclusive, to tell you how long ago this was). Thankfully, our long national nightmare is over, as the robots (and Walt Disney Records) have blessed us with The Complete Edition, now available to stream and download (a Mondo vinyl version, released a few weeks ago, quickly sold out but will be repressed in 2021). Adding 9 more tracks to the Grammy-winning album, it truly is the fullest version of the instantly iconic score released yet. (Damnably, that Jay-Z songremains lost.)\nadvertising\nWhen Tron Legacy was released a decade ago, it got a decidedly mixed reception. While many celebrated its arresting, innovative visuals, others criticized the storyline and characterizations (occasionally, some reviewers did both). But almost everybody agreed: the soundtrack was genuinely incredible. The first true soundtrack by the electronic trailblazers, the score combined the duos usual electronic noodling with full-bodied symphonic flourishes. It was unlike anything anybody had heard before, and it helped Daft Punk realize their masterpiece Random Access Memories, which had several orchestral interludes that would have been impossible without their work on Tron Legacy.\nAnd now you can luxuriate in an even more full-bodied version of the score with tracks like Encom, Part II and Father and Son that you genuinely will not believe was never a part of the official soundtrack release. Theyre just so good. And well have more from the making of Tron Legacy, including some never-before-heard stories about the score, very soon.\nadvertising",

            "body": "Daft Punk\n's official soundtrack from the fan-favorite movie has been released online. Polygonreports that this version is being billed as TRON: Legacy - The Complete Edition and is available now on Spotify and Apple Music, featuring nine additional tracks. The site does note however that these tracks have been heard by the public before thanks to various vinyl releases and iTunes exclusives, but this collection of the tracks from the 2010 feature film mark the first time that all of them have been together in one place.\nThough the feature film didn't catch on when it was first released, though a reappraisal of its quality is ongoing, the soundtrack from the musical pair was always marked as a highlight.

We started working on the music while I was prepping the movie, so it was this amazing thing where I had tracks, I had elements of the soundtrack while I was shooting the movie. I would play the album on set while we were setting up shots and stuff. It just set the tone and mood and I just really remember that.\"\nHe added, \"I just remember playing them that soundtrack on the set of the safe house, which was Kevin Flynn's house with the up-lit floor and everyone ",
