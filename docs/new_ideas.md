- Visualiser --> Display Historical Data as a Graph (image sent to the server)
- Have error checking for incorrect cryptocurrency codes

- Include market cap in !list
- Add the ability to change what news is tracked every 8 hours (make it so it can accept symbols too)
- Make the error messages more helpful
- REMEMBER TO DESERIALISE THE JSON EVERY HOUR TO SEE UPDATED WATCH LIST AND PING LIST DATA
- MAKE SURE YOU REMOVE SERVERS FROM THE DATABASE WHEN THE BOT GETS KICKED
- Update the help command, and the intro tutorial message
- Make the newsfeed use less API calls (since it calls once for EVERY server)
- Add the ability to change currency
- Add the ability to convert between cryptocurrencies (i.e. 1 BTC = 35.67 ETH)
 - !convert 1000 BTC to ETH
- Make !raw an option within !crypto, or else it won't work with multiple people calling !crypto, and then asking for the raw data
- Limit news descriptions to 25 characters, followed by a trailing '...' to make it more aesthetically pleasing (if they aren't already under that length), to prevent them being too chunky
