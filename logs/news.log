            "body": "Navjotpal Kaur and Sumeet Sekhon: Women take lead roles in Indias farmers protest\nBack to video\nFarmers are demanding the Indian government retract the laws, introduced during COVID-19 lockdowns without consulting stakeholders. According to experts the laws, aimed at liberalizing Indian agriculture, will gradually drive out small and marginal farmers by creating private monopolies in the market.\nGiven that 86 per cent of farmers in India are small landholders (owning less than two hectares), strong opposition to the laws is hardly surprising at all.\nThe protest has garnered huge community support from India and abroad. It has also managed to include and mobilize women. In this way, the farmers protests show how modern protest sites can be spaces of resistance and power but also of gender equity and empowerment.\nAdvertisement\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\nArticle content continued\nMostly led by Sikh farmers from Punjab, the protest space reflects the Sikh ethos of langar (free meals), sewa (service), and charhdi kala (high spirits).\nThe seismic waves of the protest are not only being felt in India but in different countries across the world where the Indian, and particularly Punjabi, diaspora are holding massive rallies against the farm laws.\nPunjab and Haryana, the two states leading the farmers protest, are characterized by deeply entrenched feudal, patriarchal structures that place significant, deliberate and inadvertent constraints on women. Furthermore, both Punjab and Haryana continue to be counted among the countrys worst-performing states in terms of female-to-male sex ratios.\nUsually, in typical agrarian patriarchal societies, women and men do not have equal access to household resources. This inequality is worsened during times of economic hardships. In other words, decisions are more likely to be skewed in fav",

They also demanded DGP MV Rao to step up policing to curb the incidents of crime. The demonstration was jointly held by Ranchi Press Club and Ranchi chapter of Jharkhand Union of Journalists to protest against the gruesome murder of a 28-year-old Sanket Mishra, son of a Khunti-based vernacular journalist Anil Mishra. On Thursday evening, Sankets charred body was recovered from a secluded place under Karra police station. His throat had been slit.\nRajat Gupta, an editor of a vernacular daily in Ranchi and president of National Union of Journalists, said journalists or their family are continuously facing attack since the last couple of years.\nIts time, the state government should work towards bringing a law for the safety of journalists and their family, who are often facing threat, he said, demanding compensation for the Khunti victims family and a government job.\nOn the other hand, Khunti police are yet to crack the murder case. Police sources said the deceased had left for Khunti from his in-laws place in Ranchi on Tuesday on a bike. He was later found murdered.\nHundreds of members of the JUJ Pradesh Committee and the Ranchi Press Club, along with the metropolitan unit of Jharkhand Union of Journalists have participated in the protest.\nAdvertisement",

He also wrote a similar  letter to US Ambassador to India Ken Juster.\nThousands of farmers from Punjab, Haryana and UP have been  protesting at the borders of Delhi since November 24 demanding to scrap the  three farm laws. Calling these laws as \"anti-farmer\", these farmers  believe that the newly enacted bills would dismantle the minimum support-price  system, leaving them at the \"mercy\" of big corporations.\nHe is the latest US leader who expressed  concern of the farmers' protest. Last month seven US legislators have  written to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo requesting him to raise with his  Indian counterpart the issue of farmer's protest.\nOn January 4 Robin J Vos wrote: \"One thing Wisconsin and India may have in common is  our large agricultural economies. The farmers of our state are a very large  part of our overall economy. It would be unfathomable to me that we would make  law changes that affect them without taking their input into account, or by  shutting them down as they exercised their right to peaceably assemble.\n\"Hopefully, the Modi government will  reconsider its decision and sit down with the affected farmers to listen to  their conc",

While Baba Lakha Singh, who has been organising langar at the protest sites, said he wished to mediate between the government and the protesting farmers, Tomar played down the meeting and the farm unions said the religious leader wasnt speaking for them.\nFridays talks will be between a ministerial committee including Tomar, Food Minister Piyush Goyaland Minister of State for Commerce and Industry Som Prakash, and 41 representatives of farm organisations.

It has also managed to include and mobilize women. In this way, the farmers protests show how modern protest sites can be spaces of resistance and power but also of gender equity and empowerment.\nDemocratic alienation\nDemocratic alienation and an increasing distance between citizens and decision makers seems to be the hallmark of the Modi-led Indian government. An example of this was seen during the Shaheen Bagh protest to the Citizenship Amendment Act.\nShaheen Bagh and the ongoing farmers protest are among the biggest protests to rock India in recent times. A noteworthy feature of both these protests is that they have challenged the stereotypes of Indian women that have been dominated by their supposed passivity in the face of victimhood.\nThe farmers protest, however, is distinct from the Shaheen Bagh protest in the sense that it has garnered unprecedented community support. Mostly led by Sikh farmers from Punjab, the protest space reflects the Sikh ethos of langar (free meals), sewa (service), and charhdi kala (high spirits).\nThe seismic waves of the protest are not only being felt in India but in different countries across the world where the Indian, and particularly Punjabi, diaspora are holding massive rallies against the farm laws.\nWomen lead protests\nPunjab and Haryana, the two states leading the farmers protest, are characterized by deeply entrenched feudal, patriarchal structures that place significant, deliberate and inadvertent constraints on women. Furthermore, both Punjab and Haryana continue to be counted among the countrys worst-performing states in terms of female-to-male sex ratios.\nAdvertisement\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\nArticle content continued\nUsually, in typical agrarian patriarchal societies, women and men do not have equal access to household resources.

Ramasubramanian further asked if farmers protesting at various Delhi borders are taking precautions to contain the spread of Covid-19.\nWhen the Attorney General responded in the negative, the higher court said it could turn into a situation like that of the Nizamuddin Markaz congregation in the national capital, which happened in March last year.  Mehta replied that he will find the state.\nThe higher court asked the Center to present a report on the measures taken so far to contain Covid and issued a notice regarding a guilty plea filed by Supriya Pandita through lawyer Omprakash Parihar.\nThe high court emphasized that it is concerned if precautions against the spread of Covid are not taken in large gatherings.\nThe bank said it is trying to ensure that Covid-19 does not spread and asked the Center to ensure that the guidelines are strictly followed.\nPandita had moved to the high court questioning the role of the Center, the Delhi government and the Delhi police for allowing the huge congregation, including foreign delegates in Nizamuddin Markaz, to endanger ",
