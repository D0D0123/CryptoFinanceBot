            "body": "NASA to send humans in EM-2 rocket\nPosted by\nJanuary 18, 2021\nNASA has planned to bring about quite a number of changes to its newly designed more spacious rocket. This change has been propelled with the help of a huge funding boost that has been received from the Government. NASA has plans to send human beings along with the rockets by 2020. When they travel along with rockets, it is highly possible that they will ride on a more advanced version of the vehicle as NASA has expected. The vehicle would be much less powerful. So if this decision persists, it will scale down the first human-led rocket into space after 45 years.\nDetails of the project\nThis Space launching System has been in the making for almost a decade once it will be completed, then it would be NASAs first project to carry humans in rockets up to Mars and Moons. Initially, NASA had planned to launch two very important projects. The very first flight was named as EM-1. However, according to NASA, it will uncrewed. In substitute to this plan, NASA will be launching a smaller version of the rocket which is scheduled to hover around the Moon for three long weeks. Within a period of three years, NASA will be coming up with a more advanced version of such rocket that will be circling around the Moon. The name of this rocket has been decided as\nEM-2, Exploration Mission 2.\nBut according to the sources, it is likely that NASA will defer the rocket up gradation process. In such case, the smaller version will only be used for the time being. According to Robert Lightfoot, they would require modifying the mission structure because they wont be able to launch\nunless and until they are in a position to use SLS.\nClarification from NASA\nNASA has stated that ",

Everyone on the team who is not in mission control right now is going absolutely bonkers. Orbit tweeted, Even the folks on comms are trying really hard not to sound too excited.\nCarrying 10 small satellites for NASA, Orbit confirmed that the LauncherOne vehicle would coast for around half an hour, before delivering its payload of small, cube-like satellites.\nAn hour later Orbit confirmed by Twitter, The payload separation command was issued as planned.

The series was the linchpin of the Apple TV+ launch in 2019, and proved popular enough with viewers to warrant a second season.\n(Some spoilers for the first season below.)\nSeries creator Ronald D. Moore (Battlestar Galactica) has made a point of trying to keep the show reasonably close to reality, despite the science fiction concept, often consulting the original NASA plans for guidance, and incorporating archival footage throughout the season. Moore said the following during a 2019 panel Q&A after an IMAX screening of the first two S1 episodes at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, DC:\nOur production designer, Dan Fisher, who designed all the sets of the show, recreated Mission Control in such exacting detail that even the ceiling tiles [are] the same as the ceiling tiles in the original mission control. When we were on set, we had technical consultants and former astronauts who were actually there, who would walk the cast through how to operate the command module and the lunar module. We had people that would talk to the background players in Mission Control, so that people weren't just randomly pushing buttonsthey knew exactly what the console did and who they were talking to on those headsets, and that permeated the entire production.\nThe first season centered on an astronaut named Ed Baldwin (Joel Kinnaman), standing in for Thomas Stafford, the Apollo 10 commander in our real-world timeline. His foil is fellow astronaut Gordo Stevens (Michael Dorman), the stereotypical hard-drinking, womanizing fighter pilot to Baldwin's All-American \"right stuff\" persona.

The hot fire is the final test of the Green Run series.\nThe test plan called for the rockets four RS-25 engines to fire for a little more than eight minutes  the same amount of time it will take to send the rocket to space following launch. The team successfully completed the countdown and ignited the engines, but the engines shut down a little more than one minute into the hot fire. Teams are assessing the data to determine what caused the early shutdown, and will determine a path forward.\nFor the test, the 212-foot core stage generated 1.6 million pounds of thrust, while anchored in the B-2 Test Stand at NASAs Stennis Space Center near Bay St. Louis, Mississippi. The hot fire test included loading 733,000 pounds of liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen  mirroring the launch countdown procedure  and igniting the engines.\nSaturdays test was an important step forward to ensure that the core stage of the SLS rocket is ready for the Artemis I mission, and to carry crew on future missions, said NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine, who attended the test. Although the engines did not fire for the full duration, the team successfully worked through the countdown, ignited the engines, and gained valuable data to inform our path forward.\nSupport teams across the Stennis test complex provided high-pressure gases to the test stand, delivered all operational electrical power, supplied more than 330,000 gallons of water per minute to protect the test stand flame deflector and ensure the structural integrity of the core stage, and captured data needed to evaluate the core stage performance.\nSeeing all four engines ignite for the first time during the core stage hot fire test was a big milestone for the Space Launch ",

This magnificent flight is the culmination of many years of hard work and will also unleash a whole new generation of innovators on the path to orbit.\nA new gateway to space has just sprung open! That LauncherOne was able to successfully reach orbit today is a testament to this teams talent, precision, drive, and ingenuity. Even in the face of a global pandemic, weve maintained a laser focus on fully demonstrating every element of this revolutionary launch system. That effort paid off today with a beautifully executed mis",

Credit: Virgin Orbit\nCOVINGTON, La.  Virgin Orbits LauncherOne rocket reached orbit on its second flight Jan. 17, demonstrating the performance of the air-launch system after years of development.\nThe companys Boeing 747 aircraft, called Cosmic Girl, took off from the Mojave Air and Space Port in California at 1:38 p.m. Eastern with the LauncherOne rocket attached. The plane flew out over the Pacific just off the Southern California coast and released the rocket at about 2:39 p.m. Eastern.\nThe rocket ignited its NewtonThree first stage engine for three minutes, followed by stage separation and ignition of the NewtonFour engine in the rockets second stage for nearly six minutes. After a 46-minute coast, the rocket reignited the NewtonFour for a five-second burn, followed by payload deployment in an approximately 500-kilometer orbit, although Virgin Orbit took more than an hour to confirm those final steps.\nThe launch was the capstone of a development program that dates back to July 2012, when Virgin Galactic announced its intent to develop a small launch vehicle to complement its SpaceShipTwo suborbital vehicle. LauncherOne was originally planned to use the same WhiteKnightTwo carrier aircraft as SpaceShipTwo, but the company later decided to acquire a Boeing 747 for use as a carrier aircraft. Virgin Galactic spun out the LauncherOne project into a separate company, Virgin Orbit, in 2017.\nThe customer for the Launch Demo 2 mission was NASA under a contract awarded in 2015 as part of its Venture Class Launch Services program to support emerging small launch vehicle developers. The mission, called ELaNa 20 by NASA, carried 10 cubesats from eight universities an",
