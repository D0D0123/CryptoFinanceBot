The Ethereum-based protocol, founded on the proprietary of automated fair market economics logic models, will host all games on its decentralized gaming platform exchange, or gDEX. The first game to be marketed is Battle Wave 2323 and will allow players to compete on virtual teams to see who can earn the highest APY through gamified liquidity mining and NFT staking and trading.\nJ.D. Salbego\n, founder and CEO of AnRKey X, explained: \"We're extremely proud and excited to be on both Bithumb and Uniswap as we embark on our journey to bring our amazing gaming platform to users. The strategy to be also listed on Uniswap at the same time is to protect our investors and our Arcade Coin price, building price discovery and price floor on the centralized exchange to allow market price and liquidity support to resolve the challenges of unibots as well as misconceptions that unibots give investors as they pump up the price artificially before dumping and crashing the price.\"\nAnRKey X gained overnight success after slowly emerging from obscurity to launching its gaming concept, which merges DeFi, esports and Web 3.0 NFTs. The team at AnRKey X comprises seasoned blockchain entrepreneurs, influencers and advisors. The project leveraged its global team and built communities in the West, as well as\nAsia\n, which is one of its primary markets.\nThe $ANRX arcade coin is a token that has 12 medium-of-exchange utility functions and acts much like an arcade coin used in a game arcade. The more a player uses its multiple functions to buy, play, stake, sell and compete, the more $ANRX can be received in the gaming sys",

But in Curve finance, we can swap only stable coins, no other coins not possible to exchange here. Along with we can provide liquidity or we can participate in pools also from both we earn up to 19% APR at present market conditions. Maybe it may gey up and downs as per market conditions.\nCurrent Lockup Money In Different Pools\nCurve platform looking very simple to use but for beginners not possible to understand. In my opinion for swap, stable coins curve is a good choice rather than Uniswap. Because here we get a huge combination with good volume.\nSwap between stablecoins in single click\nCurrently Curve supporting DAI, USDC, USDT, TUSD, BUSD and USD, as well as BTC pairs too.\nFor swap stable coins in Uniswap we need to spend more money on a trading fee but coming to Curve it is very low around 0.04%, with one click we can finish complete trading with minimal slippage and low fee.\nCurve starting price around $60 but now it trading between 0.6$ , major dump it gets in past months. Hope it can recover soon because its use cases increasing day by day.\nAs at other platforms,Curve is not completelyDecentralized finance at Lunch, run by the Curve team, led by Michael Egorov, the founder of NuCypher with a Ph.D. in Physics.\nThis means that while it may be a great concept and plans. Hope soon their plans work perfectly and give good results.\nOne more thing is, It works on automated market maker (AMM) protocol. So on lending its assets it gets good returns from those they running thins platform successfully. But not getting that much attention from users but hope soon it recover fast.\nAll those factors encourgae me to invest in Curve.\nSimple Curve is ** Ethereum-based Defi protocols** so anyone can provide liq",

It now sits at $1.75 billion and is still falling.\nUniswap TVL:\nDeFi Pulse\nFollowing the sharp decline in Uniswaps liquidity, token holders have embarked on the process of voting for a new governance proposal that seeks to reinstate rewards in the form of UNI tokens for liquidity providers.\nThe new proposal put forward by Cooper Turley of crypto-powered music streaming platform Audius, cuts the amount of UNI rewards in half compared to the former program. While 2.5 million UNI tokens were previously distributed to the liquidity providers of Uniswaps WTBC/ETH, USDC/ETH, USDT/ETH and DAI/ETH pools each month, the new proposal would see 1.25 million UNI designated to each pool monthly for two months  equating to 10 million tokens total, or roughly 4.6% of UNIs current circulating supply.\nThe community will first vote on a \nsnapshot poll\n, which must receive 25,000 votes in favor within three days to proceed onto a secondary consensus check poll with double the required vote quorum over five days.\nShould the consensus check garner 50,000 yes-votes, Audius proposition will become a fully-fledged governance proposal that must attract 40 million affirmative votes in order to be approved for implementation.\nThe proposal was published on the same day that rival DEX SushiSwap unveiled new incentives for providing liquidity to the four pairings Uniswap has stopped providing incentives for.
