            "body": "BitMEX\nin August 2020 but quickly gave up leverage trading after losing $200. It was right when the DeFi craze had picked up traction with yield farming as the main attraction. New projects were popping up from left to right, allowing users to deposit their cryptocurrencies as collateral and earn interest on it while getting rewarded with the projects token.\nIf this wasnt enough, some DeFi-related tokens were doing a 10-100X overnight on decentralized exchanges like Uniswap, 1inch exchange, among others, leaving investors stunned and with hefty profits.\nThe anonymous trader was among a group of very few investors who took advantage of the DeFi craze. From basic research to scouting potential investors fund flow on Etherscan, Razoreth got an edge over other investors.\nI came up with a strategy of only buying tokens that were under a day old and NEVER going to sleep holding something that had the potential of rugging. The majority of profits on new tokens are made in the first 3 hours, so I tried being one of the first 10 to buy something.\nMost of Razroeths investments involved buying presale tokens like CORE, Hacken, and SUSHI and selling them for huge profits. By the end of August 2020, the trader allegedly had 1.8 ETH and finished September with 500 ETH.\nBy December, Razroeth had increased his risk appetite by investing an average of 50 to 100 ETH. Since the trader held most of the profits in either Bitcoin or Ethereum, the current bull run did the rest of the job and pushed his portfolio to $1,000,000.\nCan DeFi still make you a millionaire?\nA question or a version of it lingering in the readers heads would be, Can I do the same? The answer to this is complicated since Bitcoin put an end to the DeFi summer.\nWhile the hype around the ecosystem hasnt died yet, many DeFi projects have strong fundamentals and hence, a chance to perhaps double or triple investments ev",

I think those are legitimate fears,\" Ledbetter says. But he also finds them \"overblown.\"\nBecause while bitcoin allows for users to transact without revealing personal information or identity (potentially making fraud easier), it's not totally anonymous. Each bitcoin transaction is documented on a digital ledger called the blockchain, where a user's cryptocurrency \"wallet\" is represented as a unique series of random numbers and letters. Through this, a scammer could potentially be traced after the fact\n\"I always remind people that bitcoin literally has a public ledger,\" Pompliano says.\nPlus, bitcoin is extremely hard to hack thanks to blockchain.\n\"To hack it, you would have to take over the network, and to take over the network, you would need your own network of computers running 24/7, and to do that, it would cost billions of dollars,\" according to Paul Vigna markets reporter at The Wall Street Journal.\nLedbetter also points out that a traditional stock account with a brokerage could be compromised too. \"There's always some potential for fraud or security risk.\"\nThe safest bet is to use a trusted brokerage, experts say  \"these established places have a good security protocol and a quick application to protect,\" Ledbetter says.\nAll in all, \"things happen,\" he says, \"but when you look at the big stories of theft, they tend to be institutional and kind of on the fringes.\"\nAccording to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) website cryptocurrency scams are \"a popular way for scammers to trick people into sending money,\" and most scams can \"appear as emails trying to blackmailsomeone, online chain referral schemes or bogus investm",

I have raised 4 tickets, I had one response that said someone would look at it in 24-48 hours and still nothing. There is no phone support.\n'I'm obviously petrified that I'm going to lose 7,000 and there seems to be no way to contact them or do anything about it, the internet is littered with similar complaints.'\nAfter his account was finally unlocked, 'I took the opportunity and sold my crypto and closed the account with them', he said.\nWhat is a cryptocurrency exchange?\nCryptocurrency exchanges are platforms, mobile apps and websites which allow investors to purchase bitcoin with government, or fiat, money or with another cryptocurrency.\nMeanwhile those who wish to hold bitcoin for the purpose of sending or spending it, rather than simply to make a profit from an increase in the price, will likely need a cryptocurrency 'wallet'.\nThis contains public and private 'keys', which help provide details and keep users' cryptocurrencies safe.\nIt",

And the income tax treatment of assets is not the same as the reporting requirements for FBAR purposes.\nOn June 4, 2014, Rod Lundquist, a senior program analyst for the Small Business/Self-Employed Division, was asked about this issue and confirmed that, for FBAR purposes, Bitcoin was not reportable \"...not at this time.\" He followed up by saying that \"FinCEN has said that virtually currency is not going to be reportable on the FBAR, at least for this filing season.\"\nThe IRS further confirmedthat treatment, stating, The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, which issues regulatory guidance pertaining to Reports of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (FBARs), is not requiring that digital (or virtual) currency accounts be reported on an FBAR at this time but may consider requiring such accounts to be reported in the future. No additional guidance is available at this time.\nNow, FinCEN is taking a different tack. On December 30, 2020, FinCEN published a short notice. That notice, FinCEN Notice 2020-2, reads:\nCurrently, the Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (FBAR) regulations do not define a foreign account holding virtual currency as a type of reportable account. (See 31 CFR 1010.350(c)). For that reason, at this time, a foreign account holding virtual currency is not reportable on the FBAR (unless it is a reportable account under 31 C.F.R. 1010.350 because it holds reportable assets besides virtual currency). However, FinCEN intends to propose to amend the regulations implementing the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) regarding repo",

The move makes it possible for banks to use cryptocurrency tied to the dollar to make online and cross-border transactions extremely fast without the need for federal infrastructure.\nStablecoins are cryptocurrency that resist the technologys characteristic price volatility by tying their value to an external variable, like the dollar or commodities. They use the same blockchain technology as other cryptocurrencies, each user hosting an index to create a peer-to-peer network to verify transactions and monitor holdings.\nThanks to recent action from the Treasury, the ranks of those peers may soon include Americas largest banks. A  Monday releasefrom the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the people in charge of implementing U.S. monetary policy, clarified that banks are permitted to participate in stablecoin networks and complete stablecoin transactions.\nThe primary role of banks is to act as financial intermediaries, facilitating the flow of money and credit among different parts of the economy, the announcement read. The evolving financial needs of the economy have led to a demand for banks to use [independent node verification networks] to carry out their financial functions.\nThat role of an intermediary is what has so many people excited. The Federal Reserve has been slow to create the infrastructure needed for a true digital dollar letti",

The cryptocurrency has doubled in less than a month and quadrupled in the past year.\nBitcoins current price means the currency has a valuation of more than $700 billion, according\nArs Technica\n. Bitcoin, however, is by no means the only cryptocurrency. Ether is worth an estimated $140 billion, Tether $22 billion, Litecoin $11 billion and Bitcoin Cash $8 billion.\nCollectively, these cryptocurrencies now represent a $1 trillion valuation. In addition, there are still some high-profile cryptocurrencies yet to be released, such as Facebooks Libra, now known as Diem\nIt remains to be seen just how high cryptocurrencies valuation will go as the industry continues to mature.",
