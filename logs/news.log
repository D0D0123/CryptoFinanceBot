National cabinet also agreed masks would be made mandatory on all domestic and international flights, Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced on Friday. Anyone who tested positive themselves or had a household contact who had tested positive while overseas would not be allowed on to a plane headed for Australia. Chief medical officer Paul Kelly admitted the testing was not fool proof, as an individual could later test positive, but it was an added measure that would boost Australia's defences. All workers involved in the quarantine process, including cleaners, transport workers, medical staff and more, will now be subject to daily testing nationally. They had previously been required to get tested once a week. Brisbane is set to be placed into a three-day lockdown from 6pm on Friday, after a hotel quarantine cleaner tested positive to the UK strain of the virus. Professor Kelly warned anyone who had been in the Greater Brisbane area since January 2 that they should assume the restrictions in Brisbane now applied to them. They should isolate, get tested and watch for any symptoms. The number of international travellers returning to Australia will be reduced until February 15. Arrivals in New South Wales, Western Australia and Queensland will be reduced by 50 per cent. The number of returned travellers arriving in Victoria would not change as it was already operating below 50 per cent capacity. Mr Morrison announced no specific change to international arrivals for the ACT as he said the smaller airports were operating on bespoke arrangements that would be negotiated going forward.

            "body": "Video\nmultimedia, video,\nFragments of a meteor that soared over Canberra Wednesday night could be lying somewhere near the New South Wales and Victorian border, but experts said it was unlikely it caused damage.  A number of Canberrans reported seeing the bright green fireball flying over the city about 6.45pm on Wednesday.  ANU Astrophysicist Brad Tucker said the meteor likely entered the atmosphere over the NSW Central Coast and travelled over Sydney, west of Canberra, before exploding in a \"sonic boom\" somewhere near the Victorian and NSW border.   \"This rock comes in, when you're seeing that bright fireball that's the rock in the Earth's atmosphere essentially burning up,\" he said.  \"It gets super hot, starts to melt and at some point it explodes in fragments.\"  He said the meteor would have been up to one metre in size and didn't pose a threat.  \"There is likely somewhere from Jindabyne down to the border with a few space rocks in someone's backyard or paddock right now, but it wouldn't have created a crater,\" he said.  \"This thing shatters and a few bits rain down.\" Dr Tucker said the fireball got its bright green and blue colour from iron and nickle burning up as it entered Earth's atmosphere. IN OTHER NEWS:  He said due to the size of the rock, it was unlikely to have caused much damage.  \"200 tonnes of rock hit the earth everyday but most of the earth is uninhabited, if you think about oceans and Antarctica,\" he said.  \"They may also happen during the day time, something like this you may not even see during the daytime because it wouldn't be big enough to see, this one probably we would have. \"We're seeing a lot more now because people have dashcams and footage, as an easy way of tracking it.\"\nhttps://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/YSE9Nkng6wVvRADAVf7nRi/1c7b1beb-f39c-4b0d-91e8-ecc58916e65e.PNG/r2_17_864_504_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg",

That is why we are taking a very cautious approach there,\" Dr Chant said.\nThe flight crew had already left Australian quarantine and had landed in Singapore by the time the familys test results were known.\nSingaporean authorities have been informed and all crew are undergoing testing.\nSouth African authorities found the new variant rapidly became the dominant circulating strain, suggesting it is more transmissible.\nLab studies of the South African variant indicate the mutation changes the component of the virus the immune system responds to, which could mean antibodies are less effective against it.\nAmong the six people with the UK variant, two are still quarantined in Special Health Accommodation and four have been discharged after medical assessments deemed they were no longer infectious, Dr Chant said.\n\"There will be mutations arising everywhere,\" says NSW Chief Health Officer Kerry Chant.\nCredit:\nJames Alcock\nBut on Friday the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee did not recommend barring UK arrivals.\n\"One of the challenges of just targeting one particular country or UK strain is that we are a world, international travellers go everywhere, and I think we have learned that with COVID, we cannot block a particular group at a particular point in time,\" Dr Chant said.\n\"There will be mut",

            "body": "National\nnews, national,\nNews this morning that Queensland is imposing a three-day lockdown on Greater Brisbane has seen Australia's other states and territories change their border and quarantine rules for Queenslanders or those returning from Brisbane. The Brisbane lockdown comes on the back of a hotel quarantine worker being diagnosed with the more infectious United Kingdom strain of COVID-19. The worker was in the Greater Brisbane community for five days before being diagnosed. Here's how the new border rules are playing out as of Friday afternoon, January 8, 2021: The NT's Chief Health Officer has declared Greater Brisbane a COVID-19 hotspot, effective immediately. The hotspot includes the local government areas of Brisbane, Logan, Ipswich, Moreton and Redlands. Anyone arriving in the NT from these regions must enter mandatory quarantine for 14 days. Acting NT Chief Minister Nicole Manison said returned NT residents who have been in the hotspot since January 2 should get tested. Read more here. WA Premier Mark McGowan has announced that the State's borders will close to Queensland. As of midnight on Friday, travel from Queensland will no longer be permitted except for exempt travellers. People who have arrived from Queensland since January 2 must go into self-quarantine until they have completed 14 days in WA. Recent arrivals will also be required to be tested for COVID-19 by Tuesday, 12 January. Read more here. Travellers to South Australia from Greater Brisbane will be required to quarantine for 14 days. The restrictions will take effect from Saturday, while anyone who has arrived since January 2 will be required to be tested three times, but will not need to isolate. Premier Steven Marshall said SA would not hesitate to impose tighter restrictions on Queensland if necessary, while Chief Public Health Officer Nicola Spurrier said the latest developments were worrying.
