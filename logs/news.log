People have been steadily losing faith in their government currencies for years, and the monetary policies resulting from the economic impact of the coronavirus have only accelerated this decline.\nIt trades on numerous exchanges, the largest of which is Coinbase, which is itself preparing to go public to become the first major U.S. cryptocurrency exchange to list on Wall Street.\nMultiple competitor cryptocurrencies use similar blockchain, or electronic ledger, technology. Ethereum, the second biggest, gained 465% in 2020 and was up almost 7% on Saturday. (Reporting by Alden Bentley; Editing by Daniel Wallis, Diane Craft and Andrea Ricci)\nArticle Sidebar",

Parabolic moves on securities that are backed by tangible assets can easily decline by -50% or more. For \"Seinfeld\" securities (backed by nothing) the price can go to zero. And these folks won't even have tulip bulbs to show for their trouble.\nConclusion: Bitcoin is experiencing a strong parabolic advance. We know parabolic moves end swiftly and painfully. The weekly PMO on the above chart presents a negative divergence, but we could still see the vertical advance continue. Nevertheless, a trailing stop is essential.\nHappy Charting!\nTechnical Analysis is a windsock, not",

(File photo: REUTERS/Dado Ruvic)\nThis could drive up inflation, which in turn lowers peoples purchasing power. Indeed the US Federal Reserve last year signalled it would be slightly more tolerant of rising prices when it relaxed its 2 per cent inflation target.\nIn the face of this threat, investments like bitcoin are being consider a store of value. The maximum number of bitcoin that will ever exist is set at 21 million (unless the protocol changes), and there are already about 18.5 million in circulation.\nThe supply of new coins is also slowing down because the reward that bitcoin miners receive for verifying transactions on the blockchain halves roughly every four years  it fell from BTC12.5 to BTC6.25 last May.

Digital currency Bitcoin hit new breathtaking heights as well.\nby:\nJanuary 8, 2021\nGetty Images\nU.S. stock markets finished the first week of 2021 with yet more gains as investors, still high on hopes of even more federal stimulus and a less tumultuous political landscape, managed to slog through several disquieting developments.\nDaily COVID deaths on Thursday eclipsed the 4,000 mark for the first time, and the White House coronavirus task force warned of a \"USA variant\" that might be more contagious.\nThe 11 Best Vanguard Funds for 2021\nThat comes as the Labor Department announced a decline of 140,000 jobs in December  the first drop since April and far worse than the 50,000 nonfarm payroll gains expected.\n\"Most of this drop was concentrated in leisure and hospitality, as new lockdown restrictions were introduced or expanded in different states,\" says Gene Goldman, chief investment officer at Cetera Investment Management. And because the report only reflects payrolls through mid-December, before many restrictions were introduced, \"the February report will likely reflect more of those job losses.\"\n\"It appears the ongoing battle against the pandemic is putting pressure on the real economy once again and despite what financial markets are signaling, the labor market is indicating there is still a ways to go on the economic road to recovery,\" says Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz Investment Management. \"Overall, the ability for Congress to provide additional fiscal support has increased and today's employment report simply beckons them to do so.\"\nBut additional relief might not necessarily be on the way.

The bitcoin bubble will pop at some point over the next few months if not sooner, but until then gold is losing the backbone of big-money interest.\nGold for February delivery\non New Yorks Comex settled at $1,835.40 an ounce, down $78.20, or 4.3% on the day. A week ago, February gold hovered at $1,901.60. The drop on the week was the most for gold since the week ended Nov. 7 when\nPfizer\nPFE\n) announced the 95% efficacy in its Covid-19 vaccines that suddenly became a game changer in fighting the pandemic.\nThis weeks meltdown was even more unusual given that it came as the monthly U.S. employment report showed a loss of 140,000 jobs in December  the first negative growth of its kind since April. Typically, when jobs reports are bad, gold acts as a safe-haven.\nThis time, however, the narrative was different  even ludicrous  for the believers in gold.\nThe story on Friday was that with all three legislative houses  i.e. the White House, the House of Representatives and the Senate  coming under his Democratic Partys control, President-elect Joe Biden will have stability of rule that dilutes the need to take cover in safe assets like gold.\nNever mind that the incoming president has hinted that his first order of business might be issuing checks of $2,000 for each American hurt by the coronavirus pandemic.\nBiden has also said he plans to push out at least two more comprehensive stimulus packages that could add trillions to the U.S. federal debt, already estimated at $3.8 billion for 2020.\nIn ordinary times, the combined impact of such spending on the dollar logically makes gold a natural hedge.\nBut these are extraordinary times when logic gets tossed out of the window. Treasury yields jumped 3% on the day and 21% on the week  the most since the week ended Aug 7, when a similar rally in bonds ",
